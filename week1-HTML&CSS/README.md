<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A startup company wishes to build a web site for their online dating business. They have employed a designer who has produced the following design using desktop publishing software. The software used by the designer only produces an image, and does not produce HTML.</span></p><img src="https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/phoenixassets/html-css-javascript/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-30%20at%2011.38.28%20PM.png" title="Image: https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/phoenixassets/html-css-javascript/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-30%20at%2011.38.28%20PM.png">
<br>
<span class="s1">The company has now contracted you to implement the design i.e. build the web page. This includes a working <i>form</i> component.&nbsp;</span>The company thinks the designer has done a great job and wants you to implement the design without altering the style.<p></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Technical Overview</b></span></p><p class="p1">









</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">From a technical point of view, the web page is constructed using HTML and CSS. Most of the HTML content are form elements. All the style parameters are handled in a style section, at the top of the same page.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Interactive Features</b></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The company requires you to have two interactive features in the web page.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2">1. When the mouse is moved over any <i>label</i> or <i>input</i> or <i>select</i> element, the text in that element is shown larger. When the mouse moves away from the element, the text returns to its normal size.</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">













</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Immediately after the user selects the image of his/her face, the image is shown in the web page. A small piece of JavaScript will be made available to you to help with this functionality. However, you are not expected to understand the JavaScript code at this stage in the course and should not create any further JavaScript for this assessment task.</span></p><p class="p1"><strong>Discussion Video</strong></p><p class="p1">Please watch the accompanying video, which shows and discusses the completed task.</p><p class="p1"><strong>What to Submit</strong><br></p><p class="p1">There are 3 parts of this assessment. You will need to submit 3 files in total, one for each part. Each subsequent part builds upon the previous part.</p><p class="p1">For Part 1, you need to create the web page content without style. Make sure you save a copy of this as, for example, part1.html, before you move on to the next part.</p><p class="p1">For Part 2, take your part 1 file and extend it by applying style. Make sure you save a copy of this as, for example, part2.html, before you move on to the next part.</p><p class="p1">For Part 3, take your part 2 file and extend it to include the interactive features. Save this as part3.html.</p><p class="p1">For Parts 2 and 3, please note that all style rules are to be included in the style section, and there should be no use of inline style.</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p1">Here are the requirements and further information for each of the 3 parts.</p><p class="p1"><b>Further Notes</b></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">










</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">You can only submit one single HTML file. Note that all style rules are to be included in the <i>style</i> section, and there is no use of inline style for this assessment.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br></span></p><p class="p2"><strong>Part 1: Web page content without style </strong></p><p class="p2"></p><ul><li>For part 1 of this assessment task, you need to assemble the components together in a web page (without style).  The result of part 1 will look like this when viewed in a browser.<br></li></ul>

<p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p2">The result of this stage is a web page which contains a form. That is, after the various form elements are selected/data is entered, the submit button can be pressed. Although it is not an absolute requirement of this assessment task, it would be good if your form is sent to an appropriate server program after the submit button is selected. For this to work the data needs to be sent to a server using the post method with enctype="multipart/form-data". The destination program used in the instructional videos is <a href="http://ihome.ust.hk/~rossiter/cgi-bin/show_everything.php" title="Link: http://ihome.ust.hk/~rossiter/cgi-bin/show_everything.php">http://ihome.ust.hk/~rossiter/cgi-bin/show_everything.php</a> .</p><p class="p2">Here is a summary of the elements needed inside the web page.</p><p class="p2">At the top<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span></p><p class="p2"></p><ul><li>An appropriate large heading e.g. <code>h1</code> or <code>h2</code> or <code>h3</code></li></ul><p></p><p class="p2">The HTML elements to be contained within the form are listed by the company as follows.</p><p class="p2">First fieldset, with legend ‘Your face’<br></p><p class="p2"></p><ul><li><code>input type="file"</code> [required]<br></li><li>An <code>img</code> element with <code>id="preview"</code></li></ul><p></p><p class="p2">Second fieldset, with legend ‘Your general details’</p><p class="p2"></p><ul><li><code>input type= "text"</code> ...

These interactive behaviors are demonstrated in the accompanying video.</div><div><br></div><div><ul><li>Style rules are added so that the label and input elements become significantly larger when the mouse is moved over them (and return to normal size when the mouse moves away from them). This can be easily achieved by using the hover <i>pseudo-class</i> for all <i>label</i> and <i>input</i> elements e.g. label:hover and input:hover. For example, <code>label:hover { font-size:40px }</code>. Add these in the <i>style</i> section of the web page.  <br></li><li>The following &lt;script&gt; instruction needs to be added before <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> , near the end of the file. It is a link to some JavaScript code. After this is added the face image will be immediately shown in the web page after the user selects a file using the file selector (the first <i>input</i> element). The JavaScript code shows the selected image in an <i>img</i> element with <code>id="preview"</code> (which should be shown under the file selector). Therefore, please ensure you use this id for your img.<br></li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>
